We experienced several critical issues with our application on January 4, 2026, which affected payment processing and user authentication. This led to users being unable to complete transactions and some experiencing service unavailability. We are currently investigating the root causes and implementing fixes to improve system performance and user experience. We expect to resolve these issues shortly and will keep users updated on our progress.
